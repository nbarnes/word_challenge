Run the test example with 'rake' or 'rake test'.  Run the main with 'rake main <filename>'.

Currently, the routine strips out numeric characters and matches on the sequences around those numerics, such that 'hen5ry' is considered to contain the sequences 'henr' and 'enry' (rather than no 4 character sequences at all).
